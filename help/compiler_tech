    Each front end uses a parser to produce the abstract syntax tree of a given source file.

    Optimization
        Some of these optimizations performed at this level include 
        dead code elimination, 
        partial redundancy elimination, 
        global value numbering, 
        sparse conditional constant propagation, and 
        scalar replacement of aggregates. 
        Array dependence based optimizations such as automatic vectorization and automatic parallelization are also performed.
        Profile-guided optimization is also possible

IR  Intermediate representation

SSA static single assignment form
CPS Continuation-passing style

Functional and logic compilers often use CPS as an intermediate representation where 
a compiler for an imperative or procedural programming language would use SSA.

TAC or 3AC  Three Address Code
        Each TAC instruction has at most three operands and is typically a combination of assignment and a binary operator.

Calling convention is an implementation-level (low-level) scheme for how subroutines receive parameters from their caller and how they return a result. 

Recursive descent parser
Recursive Descent Predictive Parsing


RTL Register Transfer Language (RTL) is a kind of intermediate representation (IR) that is very close to assembly language, such as that which is used in a compiler. 
    It is used to describe data flow at the register-transfer level of an architecture. 
    Academic papers and textbooks often use a form of RTL as an architecture-neutral assembly language.
